/* To initialize an assessment, we need to consume oConfigOfWebsite1 to initialize the state of the assessment, and we need to
 * provide accessor functions to that state.
 * A typical way to do so is to define a class and [instantiate it in RIAA style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization).
 * However, as of 2024, [bundlers like webpack, which we use here, are not able to optimize JS classes](https://gaurangtandon.com/blog/javascript-class-closure#poor-bundler-optimization).
 * Therefore, we adopt here [a recommended closure-based class-like design that should be bundler-optimizable](https://gaurangtandon.com/blog/javascript-class-closure#further-discussion).
